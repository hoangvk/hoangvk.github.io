      <h1>APPLE CRISP</h1>
      <p>Apple Crisp is our exciting 4th-year capstone design project. In a team of four, we embark on a mission to revolutionize
        organic waste management! Inspired by the 13th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations, we are dedicated to 
        combatting climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from landfills. <br></br><br></br>
        The challenges arises in the low composting rates in multi-residential buildings where accessible organic 
        waste collection is limited. Through stakeholders analysis and consideration of the project timeline, we focus on the 
        refined problem statement: design an indoor system to increase composting rates. <br></br><br></br>
        Our design goals can be summarized in three key points:
        <ul class="bullet_points">
          <li>Diverts food scraps from landfill</li>
          <li>Accessible</li>
          <li>Safe and sanitary</li><br></br>
        </ul>
        Establishing design specifications, including objectives, constraints and criteria, is crucial for evaluating 
        alternative designs. The selected final design aimed at resolving the identified issue is a dry composting device, 
        which integrates two essential mechanisms: breaking down food scraps and dehydrating moisture. To explore the
        detailed design process, please visit:
